# Bill-Payment-App
Monthly bill payments in one web page using Angular for front end and MySQL for backend
Here I have added only src and Node JS server file
To build as complete project, create a new app in angular as
                ng new Project_Name
Then necessary files will be included just add this src in the new project by deleting the src of the new project.Replace this src with that src folder.
Then run angular server as 
                ng serve --open --port 4200
Then run Node server by
                node server.js
At now there will be no backend,so add backend of your own by modifing the server.js file and corresponding component files of src folder.
